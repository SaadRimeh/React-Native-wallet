## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v19+ recommended for backend)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- Neon/PostgreSQL account for backend database

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in `backend/`:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=<your_neon_postgres_connection_string>
   PORT=5001 # or any port you prefer
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   - For development (auto-reload):
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - For production:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   The backend will run on `http://localhost:5001` by default.

### Mobile App Setup
1. Navigate to the mobile folder:
   ```bash
   cd mobile
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the Expo development server:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
4. Open the app in Expo Go, an emulator, or a simulator.

## Environment Variables
### Backend
- `DATABASE_URL`: Neon/Postgres connection string
- `PORT`: Port for the server (default: 5001)

### Mobile
- API URL is set in `mobile/constants/api.js`:
